FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

With airbnb i get to share both, because I believe the design of my appartment is also one of the reasons you choose for it. Since I travel a lot for work and private purposes, my appartment is empty quiet a lot and so i like others to enjoy it too! Also I just love to take good care of people, so whenever you come at my place I will always try to put in this little extra thing to make you smile!

As a lot of people I started renting out my place to have an extra income, to cover for my bills and to create some financial space to travel more myself. Recently I started sharing my profit with charity because I wanted it to be something more, for me. So now 5% of the profit I make renting out my appartment is donated to charity. 'SOS Kinderdorpen' at the moment, I will add more later on.

Aangezien ik zelf enorm gesteld ben op een gastvrije omgeving wanneer ik ergens op vakantie ga vind ik het fijn om dat anderen ook aan te kunnen bieden. Ik heb altijd m'n beste gedaan om mijn huis een thuis te maken. Een warm interieur zonder al teveel tierlantijntjes met veel licht en ruimte. Daarbij is er een gigantische tuin met zwembad om op het einde van de dag even te ontstressen bij mooi zomerweer.

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.

I am Son! I enjoy traveling as much as most of our guests. Cycling is my passion, for short as well as long distances.
The Antwerp Central Train Station is a short walk from my house. If you would arrive by train, I will gladly come and meet you there, if you don't find your way here.
With the Metro station and rental bike stand around the corner, you can get to the old center of Antwerp in minutes, even when it's raining (which does happen in Belgium, from time to time...)

My job allows me to choose my working hours, so I can make time for my guests. Wifi is available, as are city guide maps and metro cards.
I hope to see you soon, feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Warm greetings,
Son:)

I am Son! I enjoy traveling as much as most of our guests. Cycling is my passion, for short as well as long distances.
The Antwerp Central Train Station is a short walk from my house. If you would arrive by train, I will gladly come and meet you there, if you don't find your way here.
With the Metro station and rental bike stand around the corner, you can get to the old center of Antwerp in minutes, even when it's raining (which does happen in Belgium, from time to time...)

My job allows me to choose my working hours, so I can make time for my guests. Wifi is available, as are city guide maps and metro cards.
I hope to see you soon, feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Warm greetings,

I'm Zoë and this is me

Born and raised in Antwerp 

Studying to become a teacher in secondary school (subjects English and Arts)
Love traveling and would love to combine discovering the world and working as a teacher 
in places where it is needed most.

Completed my teaching practice in Bangalore, India for underprivileged children which was an incredible and intense experience.

I have heard about Airbnb though friends and it sounds to me like very interesting way of visiting a place + welcoming people to my own.

Our style of living is very relax, homy and natural, with enough space for ourselves and each other.

I can give good tips for places to go for drinks, food and cultural events.

I am Fabienne, 51 years old and I live with my son and my two lovely cats in Izegem, which is at about 100 km from Antwerp. I also have two daughters but they are not living at home anymore. My son is studying in Gent. 
I like to travel (I am fond of Italy) because I like to meet people and foreign cultures, 
I graduated as a translator (English/Italian/Dutch) but that was a long time ago... And that's where Antwerp comes in! As a student I spent 4 years in Antwerp at the Katholieke Vlaamse Hogeschool, which is now Lessius.
Come and share my passion for this lovely city! I'm sure you'll love its diversity! Wether you like  history, the night life,culture (such as theatre, concerts etc.) or simply shopping, you'll find it here !

For me started when I was a child my parents hat a vacation house 5 km from here. A farm we hat a wonderful time there.But for a reason they sold the house and I always wanted to come back . One day my father saw in the newspaper a house to sell here and my parents went to see it , because I hat not the time and they were very excited and so I could buy my own house in my favorite place , my dream came true , And I still very happy here.   The locale people are very kind and always ready for a talk . The nature is here so beautiful ,woods . open fields , the air is amazing here you still can bread . For me the most important start is here with to go to the bakery get me some nice pistolets and take my coffee outside and have breakfast in the sun and feel the first sunshine , Wonderful !!! Like we all have a stress full life you can take out the stress here , go for a nice walk and you forget everything , are take the bike..

The adventure of being a host:

I think in life you have to share things when you have a good life and let other people enjoy also from it . For me I wanted to make a happy and bright appartment that my guests feel at home and that they get a happy feeling,

The sunflower is a  issue in this apartment for this flower stands for sun and happiness. When you look to her it gives you a warm and lovely feeling, And this is what I try to let you feel to .

I decorated the apartment in a style of modern and antic . The best feeling is when my guest coming and they like it a lot this gives me so much pleasure than you know you were right and I feel good that I can make them happy. 

Airbnb is for me a perfect side , its well taking care of and everything is so good organized . They are very correct . I found them with also to book here . And the good thing is you always meet other people. But the important issue is that you have personal contact with the owner or guests. Because this days for me its still something more is more value in this computer world we are living in .

We do not forget as a host the life makes it also a little bit easier when you can earn something more with rented , but did may not be the first issue. You have to love people otherwise you do not have to do this . I always do the things that make me happy . And it gives value to ypur life to share things and make people happy. 

For me this side gives you also a great opportunity to discover other countries its not expensive and still you can travel and learn about other cultures. Its great !!!

So this is my story about hosting and AIRNB .

I hope to see you soon . 

Mazzel tov !!!

Do what you love and do it often.
If you don’t like something, change it.
If you don’t like your job, quit.
If you don’t have enough time, stop watching tv.
If you’re looking for the love of your life, stop. 
They will be waiting for you when you start doing the things you love.
When you eat, appreciate every last bite.
Open your mind, arms, and heart to new things and people. We are united in our differences.
Ask the next person you see what their passion is,
And share your inspiring dream with them.
Travel often, getting lost will help you find yourself.
Some opportunities only come once, seize them.
Life is about the people you meet,
And the things you create with them.

Life is short. 
Live your dream and wear your passion.

we houden van rust, kalmte, wat goed gerichte actie, contact met mensen ( we baten ook een horecazaak te Antwerpen uit) en uitwisselen van ideeen en ervaringen. 
We hebben een no nonsense- no shit mentaliteit, excuseer ons de uitdrukking, en stellen directe, eerlijke en menslievende communicatie zeer op prijs. 
Bij ons gaat het nooit om uiterlijkheden, maar om authenticiteit en commitment - intrinsieke kwaliteit, geen windowdressing.

Basicly I love the idea of travelling so I try to spend as much time possible citytripping or backpacking . I enjoy walking through a city and do some people/building watching, but also looove to climb (hike) a mountain, volcano,... The combination of getting exhausted and being surrounded by extraordinary landscapes is amazing!

On the other hand, i also enjoy a night at home, watching a good movie.

During my weekends I catch up with my friends in the city, make short trips to place nearby,...

Sinds 20 jaar run ik mijn B&B en de beeldhouwerie in het hartje van de oude stad Antwerpen.  
Met mijn partner en 3 zonen bewoon ik de 3de en 4de verdieping van ons huis, boven de beeldhouwerie, en boven de gastenkamers.  
Lang geleden werkte ik enige jaren in toerisme, en heb dus ook wel wat gereisd.  Ooit was ik een echte kamperende rugzaktoerist.  Helaas gaat dat op een zeker moment fysiek niet meer zo (website hidden) kies ik al reizend voor iets meer comfort...

Ik vind het leuk om gasten te ontvangen, ook gezinnen met kinderen.  
Toen ik zelf jaren achter elkaar in hotels woonde, miste ik het huiselijk gevoel, zelf een ei kunnen bakken, mijn bed opmaken zoals ikzelf dat wilde...
Daarom is het logies bij mij precies zoals ik het zelf het liefste zou willen : je eigen klein plekje, waar jij je spullen legt zoals je het zelf leuk vindt, en niemand die komt herschikken of jouw rommel opruimt. In je eigen mini-keukenhoek, kan je snel een  soepje brouwen, of uren koffie drinken met je lief, in je pyjama met een zachtgekookt eitje, aan het open raam van de binnenkoer.. .

Ik hou van een hartelijke vrije sfeer : iedereen is aangenaam voor elkaar, maar laat elkaar met rust.  Zo ontstaan contacten vanuit zichzelf, ongeforceerd.

My place will be unforgettable if you look for a positive and inspiring vibe indoors and outdoors. 

I love Antwerp a lot because this city gives me loads of space. It's busy but quiet, it has a relaxed atmosphere and - as you will notice - people enjoy a high quality of life. The fact that I find this city inspiring has to do a lot with my neighborhood. I couldn't be at a better location.

Because I'm a freelance writer I work alone a lot. Therefore I need to live in a place where I'm surrounded by nice coffee places and people. I'm so happy I have found it. Here, I just step out of the doorway and many many many interesting locations are within walking distance. I'm in the middle of it, but it's not crowded at all. This neighborhood, my home, they both have that natural and inspiring feel I need to be creative.

Except for Airbnb I do home exchanges a lot. Lots of working nomads (free souls, people who carry their work in their laptop so they can be productive just anywhere) have stayed here for a longer period of time. If that's your intention too, know that you will feel most welcome. You will love my desk which is located in the frontroom. It's huge, full of bright light and you can overlook the square. You will have no excuse, this place dares you. In the case you're fad up to sit here working alone, don't worry there are a lot of very nice co-working coffee bars around.

Travellers, citylovers, working nomads, yogi's, intuitive people, new economy-people they all love my place. If you're a yogi I know lots of yoga schools by experience and  great places for vegetarian food too. Just ask. 

I'll bet you will enjoy my place but please book and check it out yourself :)

My home is 85 euro a night. We will make a suitable price if you want to stay for a longer period of time. This summer (July 25 - August 22) you can even rent my place as your summer residence.

Sfeer en eigenheid is voor ons onmisbaar.. Dat maakt de plek waar je verblijft..

Daarnaast zijn we graag bezig met het creëren van nieuwe dingen; meubels maken, fotograferen, beeldend werken.

Stad en platteland is voor ons een belangrijke afwisseling, zowel om te wonen als om te reizen.

It's kind of bohemian because I have a lot of decoration and particular furniture so if you're a clean freak, it's not advised to stay at my place :) Furthermore, we have one bed and one sofa-bed, but there are also 2 extra sofa's which can be used to sleep on. So if you're with a larger group, you can also stay at our place! You've got access to the entire apartment. I will be staying with one of my friends who lives just around the corner so if ",none,"The neighborhood is extremely nice and quiet,  you have a lot of old houses in Victorian style, which makes it very pleasant to just stroll down the streets if you're into architecture. It's also a very safe neighborhood compared to other area's in town. Last super bonus is my garden, it has a little pool in the summer and it's bordered by other gardens with gigantic trees so you will only hear birds chirping and never any cars.",I am a blogger for the touristic department of our city so I will make sure that you have a little Antwerp must see guide and a map of the city ready to use.  I will also make sure that you will have a little something to eat in the morning so you won't starve.,My apartment is only 10 minutes away from the train station with public transport. From my apartment you can take a bus which will bring you to the center of the city within 5 minutes or you can walk to the center which also only takes 10 minutes.,https://a0.muscache.com/ac/pictures/90029855/ed1a4106_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/90029855/ed1a4106_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a0.muscache.com/ac/pictures/90029855/ed1a4106_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a0.muscache.com/ac/pictures/90029855/ed1a4106_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,24566781,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/24566781,Cleo,2014-12-07,"Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium","Hi! I'm Cleo Klapholz and I'm  totally passionate about travelling. At least 12 times a year I prefer to get out of the country. You only have 1 life so I'll try to go all over the globe!

The crazy name and the eager to travel I owe to my Jewish roots. My family is spread all over the world, so I always have an excuse to go on a family visit. Of course I also love to sit at home from time to time. With a good book next to my cats.
When I'm not travelling I'm probably writing for my blog (website hidden) !

Ik vind het Airbnb concept erg fijn omdat je op die manier op gezellige plekjes kan belanden, vaak vlak bij het centrum van een stad die je bv eens zou willen bezoeken.
Daarom hebben m'n vriend, Arne en ik ook ons appartement aangeboden op Airbnb. We wonen vlakbij het centrum van Antwerpen en kunnen bezoekers enkele tips geven en plekjes aanwijzen waar je anders niet meteen als 'toerist' zou belanden, iets waar wij zelf ook steeds naar op zoek gaan.

Zelf houden we erg van muziek. Luisteren naar oude vinyl-platen met een glaasje wijn in wat kaarslicht gebeurd wel eens vaker en is ook zeker een aanrader moest je hier eens logeren.
We reizen zoals ik al zei ook veel en enorm graag en staan beiden in het onderwijs, wat dit dan ook mogelijk maakt.

Ik vind het Airbnb concept erg fijn omdat je op die manier op gezellige plekjes kan belanden, vaak vlak bij het centrum van een stad die je bv eens zou willen bezoeken.
Daarom hebben m'n vriend, Arne en ik ook ons appartement aangeboden op Airbnb. We wonen vlakbij het centrum van Antwerpen en kunnen bezoekers enkele tips geven en plekjes aanwijzen waar je anders niet meteen als 'toerist' zou belanden, iets waar wij zelf ook steeds naar op zoek gaan.

Zelf houden we erg van muziek. Luisteren naar oude vinyl-platen met een glaasje wijn in wat kaarslicht gebeurd wel eens vaker en is ook zeker een aanrader moest je hier eens logeren.
We reizen zoals ik al zei ook veel en enorm graag en staan beiden in het onderwijs, wat dit dan ook mogelijk maakt.

Stuur gerust een mailtje als je eens een weekendje Antwerpen gepland hebt, wie weet is ons appartement wel vrij op dat moment!

My name is Pieter (°1985). I currently live in Antwerp (Belgium) the city where I was born, raised and studied. I graduated as a master in economics from the University of Antwerp, from where I moved to work in Amsterdam. After one year of living abroad in the beautiful city with its canals, I decided to move back, even though I’m still working most of my time out of our Amsterdam office. As a result I’m traveling quite a bit, hence why my apartment is on airbnb.

However, I don’t mind the travel, I love it. And when I’m traveling I enjoy meeting new people and exploring new cities or countries. Over the past twelve months that’s exactly what I’ve been doing. I visited San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Tel Aviv, Vienna, Monaco, Cologne, Munich, Barcelona, Paris, London, La Bresse and Cannes. I love the vibe of big cities and its people more than lying on a beach in the sun.

When I’m not traveling or at work, going to the gym consumes quite a bit of my time as well as going out with friends for dinner or drinks. I also love to read, especially novels in a foreign language (French, English or Spanish), or to night in watching a movie with friends. Give me some good Belgian chocolates and I’m a happy man!

I love the lively atmosphere of every city and try to enjoy it as much as possible. Going from concerts at festivals or parks, fashion and shopping, theatre performances, museums or just strolling through the city. And since I'm very social and quick to make contacts, the vision of an AirBnB is right up my alley. Providing a cosy space for wanderlust travelers, handing information about my town and creating some interaction without obtrusiveness. So travelling  in an unconventional way and interacting with locals is something the guests and I have in common. After travelling to San Francisco to live with a childhood friend, participating on an intercultural project in Mexico, sharing the apartment of an inhabitant in Berlin, Valladolid, Barcelona, Vienna, etc I even try to make a holiday out of being at home. Or as one of my favorite Dutch writers, Godfriend Bomans,  would put it; ""The art of living is to be at home when one is travelling"". I hope to bring my guests a feeling of ""Home"" during their stay and hopefully soon I'll meet and welcome you in Antwerp, I'm looking forward to it.

Ik ben  29 jaar, werk parttime en studeer  taal- en letterkunde aan de Universiteit van Antwerpen. Ik hou erg  van het levendige en bruisende, dat elke stad in zich heeft en probeer daar zoveel mogelijk van te genieten:  de terrasjes, optredens in parken of festivals, shoppen,   theatervoorstellingen, musea, flaneren door de stad, noem maar op.  Vermits ik vrij sociaal ben en snel  contacten maak, past de AirBnB -formule  helemaal in mijn visie: een cosy plek verschaffen aan de reislustige gasten, hen informatie geven over mijn stad en enige interactie opbouwen zonder opdringerigheid. Eén punt hebben de gasten en ik gemeen: we reizen graag, doen dit graag op een niet al te conventionele manier en houden van interactie met de plaatselijke inwoner(s).  Zo ging ik naar San Francisco om bij een jeugdvriendin in te wonen, nam deel aan een intercultureel project in Mexico,  deelde het appartement van een inwoonster in  Berlijn, Valladolid, Barcelona en Wenen, enz.  Ik probeer me ook thuis op reis te voelen of zoals de Nederlandse schrijver Godfried Bomans, één mijn favoriete schrijvers, het stelde : ” De kunst van te leven is thuis te zijn alsof men op reis is "". Ik hoop dat ik mijn gasten een gevoel van 'thuis zijn'  tijdens hun reis kan geven en hoop jullie snel te mogen verwelkomen en ontmoeten in Antwerpen..Ik kijk er alvast naar uit..

Tengo 29 años y estudio Lengua y Literatura en la Universidad de Amberes y trabajo a medio tiempo en la ciudad. Me encanta el ambiente animado de cada ciudad y trato de disfrutarlo lo más posible con paseos a conciertos en festivales o parques, a través de la moda y las compras, obras de teatro, museos o simplemente pasear por la ciudad. Como soy una persona muy social y que rápidamente hace contactos, la visión de Airbnb es lo mío. Ofrezco un espacio agradable para los viajeros con deseo de explorar, facilito información sobre mi ciudad y establezco algún tipo de interacción sin impertinencia. Viajar de una manera poco convencional e interactuar con la gente local, es algo que los clientes y yo tenemos en común. Después de haber viajado a la ciudad de San Francisco para vivir con una amiga de la infancia, participado en un proyecto intercultural en México, compartido el apartamento de un habitante de Berlín, Valladolid, Barcelona, Viena, y más lugar, hasta trato de hacer unas vacaciones estando en mi casa. Como dice uno de mis escritores Neerlandés favoritos, Godfried Bomans ""el arte de vivir es estar en casa cuando uno está viajando."" Espero darles a mis invitados una sensación de ""hogar"" durante su estancia y espero que pronto pueda darle la bienvenida en Amberes.

I love the lively atmosphere of every city and try to enjoy it as much as possible. Going from concerts at festivals or parks, fashion and shopping, theatre performances, museums or just strolling through the city. And since I'm very social and quick to make contacts, the vision of an AirBnB is right up my alley. Providing a cosy space for wanderlust travelers, handing information about my town and creating some interaction without obtrusiveness. So travelling  in an unconventional way and interacting with locals is something the guests and I have in common. After travelling to San Francisco to live with a childhood friend, participating on an intercultural project in Mexico, sharing the apartment of an inhabitant in Berlin, Valladolid, Barcelona, Vienna, etc I even try to make a holiday out of being at home. Or as one of my favorite Dutch writers, Godfriend Bomans,  would put it; ""The art of living is to be at home when one is travelling"". I hope to bring my guests a feeling of ""Home"" during their stay and hopefully soon I'll meet and welcome you in Antwerp, I'm looking forward to it.

Ik ben  29 jaar, werk parttime en studeer  taal- en letterkunde aan de Universiteit van Antwerpen. Ik hou erg  van het levendige en bruisende, dat elke stad in zich heeft en probeer daar zoveel mogelijk van te genieten:  de terrasjes, optredens in parken of festivals, shoppen,   theatervoorstellingen, musea, flaneren door de stad, noem maar op.  Vermits ik vrij sociaal ben en snel  contacten maak, past de AirBnB -formule  helemaal in mijn visie: een cosy plek verschaffen aan de reislustige gasten, hen informatie geven over mijn stad en enige interactie opbouwen zonder opdringerigheid. Eén punt hebben de gasten en ik gemeen: we reizen graag, doen dit graag op een niet al te conventionele manier en houden van interactie met de plaatselijke inwoner(s).  Zo ging ik naar San Francisco om bij een jeugdvriendin in te wonen, nam deel aan een intercultureel project in Mexico,  deelde het appartement van een inwoonster in  Berlijn, Valladolid, Barcelona en Wenen, enz.  Ik probeer me ook thuis op reis te voelen of zoals de Nederlandse schrijver Godfried Bomans, één mijn favoriete schrijvers, het stelde : ” De kunst van te leven is thuis te zijn alsof men op reis is "". Ik hoop dat ik mijn gasten een gevoel van 'thuis zijn'  tijdens hun reis kan geven en hoop jullie snel te mogen verwelkomen en ontmoeten in Antwerpen..Ik kijk er alvast naar uit..

Tengo 29 años y estudio Lengua y Literatura en la Universidad de Amberes y trabajo a medio tiempo en la ciudad. Me encanta el ambiente animado de cada ciudad y trato de disfrutarlo lo más posible con paseos a conciertos en festivales o parques, a través de la moda y las compras, obras de teatro, museos o simplemente pasear por la ciudad. Como soy una persona muy social y que rápidamente hace contactos, la visión de Airbnb es lo mío. Ofrezco un espacio agradable para los viajeros con deseo de explorar, facilito información sobre mi ciudad y establezco algún tipo de interacción sin impertinencia. Viajar de una manera poco convencional e interactuar con la gente local, es algo que los clientes y yo tenemos en común. Después de haber viajado a la ciudad de San Francisco para vivir con una amiga de la infancia, participado en un proyecto intercultural en México, compartido el apartamento de un habitante de Berlín, Valladolid, Barcelona, Viena, y más lugar, hasta trato de hacer unas vacaciones estando en mi casa. Como dice uno de mis escritores Neerlandés favoritos, Godfried Bomans ""el arte de vivir es estar en casa cuando uno está viajando."" Espero darles a mis invitados una sensación de ""hogar"" durante su estancia y espero que pronto pueda darle la bienvenida en Amberes.

我今年 29歲，在UA修語言及文學，同時在安特衛普打工。我喜歡每一個城市的熱鬧氛圍，不管是音樂節，公園演唱會，時尚購物，戲劇表演，博物館，或在市中心散步，我都盡可能找機會品嘗。另外我很樂於交朋友，不管是提供舒適的空間給旅遊愛好者，傳達關於我的城市的資訊，或無壓力的互動，我很理解也能夠發揮Airbnb想表達的精神，畢竟非凡的旅遊方式和與當地人交集是我們的共同點。

Fronk (49 y.) and Aurora (18 y.) love talking, laughing and music.
Communication is always easy as we speak several languages
Fronk is crazy about Brazil, where he lived for 2 years
Lieve adores India and Aurora is mad about Greece.
We have a preference for natural, vegetarian food.
Lieve and Fronk  practice Yoga daily..
We and our neighbours live on pleasant terms with each other.
Tranquility is a must in our home and in the building.

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site.

Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site.

Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience.

I am Frà, short for Francesca, an Italian but I moved to Belgium 10 years ago to be with Dominique, my Flemish husband, with whom I have two little girls. We are an eclectic couple, joined by many small aspects that make our cultural diversity very interesting.
I like to cook, sports and I enjoy my social life. I love the sea and the sun.
I think Antwerp is a funny and interesting city, where you can really find anything what you like on every single moment. 

 “La casa di frà” è nata dal desiderio di conoscere persone che viaggiano alla scoperta di luoghi e di culture diverse. 
Sono Frà, abbreviazione di Francesca, un’italiana che vive in Belgio da 10 anni e sposata con un fiammingo, Dominique, e abbiamo due bambine. Siamo una coppia eclettica,  le nostre diversita' culturali rendono affascinante e interessante la nostra vita. 
Mi piace cucinare, fare sport e chiacchierare con gli amici e conoscerne di nuovi. Amo il mare e il sole.
Trovo Anversa una città divertente e stimolante, tutta da scoprire.

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.
